** Pre-requisites
Pipenv is used to manage dependencies inside the project, it's recommended to use it instead of installing dependencies by trial and error.

Python 3.7 was used to develop this project and pipenv will attempt to create a python 3.7 environment, it's necessary to have it installed inside the machine.
However I would seriously recommend to instead make use of pyenv as it's much much easier than to manually install python versions and it's supported by pipenv
